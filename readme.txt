Follow these instructions:

Goto your web hosting server, and upload:
progname.txt
progver.txt
des.txt
download.exe (You have to keep this name, or you can change it in the source)

Now go threw the source and replace the file URL's to the URL's of where you uploaded them
(Example: http://members.lycos.co.uk/(USERNAME)/prog/progver.txt)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now I can explain to you how to run this thing.

Ok so the version of the source code is 1.0 and the source code checks on your server
the progver.txt, and if the versions are different it will display the frmPop. 
So basicly when you create a new version of your prog you just goto your server
and change progver.txt to the version of your application. And for progname.txt,
you set that as the name of your new program or update. des.txt is the description
of your new program.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thats basicly how you run the whole thing.
If you cant figure this out for yourself, e-mail me and ill setup an account at the same
web hosting site I use (http://www.tripod.lycos.co.uk).
